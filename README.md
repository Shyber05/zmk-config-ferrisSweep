### Personal Keyboard Setup

I have two versions of the [ferris sweep](https://github.com/davidphilipbarr/Sweep) keyboard.  

The Wired version uses [QMK firmware](https://docs.qmk.fm/) and uses the site [VIA](https://usevia.app/) to configure key mapping.  

  
  
The Wireless version uses [nice!nano](https://nicekeyboards.com/nice-nano/) v.2 micro controllers with [ZMK firmware](https://zmk.dev/) and uses the site [keymap editor](https://nickcoutsos.github.io/keymap-editor/) to make changes to the key mapping.

The case was found on printables.
