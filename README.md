### Personal Keyboard Setup

I have two versions of the [ferris sweep](https://github.com/davidphilipbarr/Sweep) keyboard  
Wired version uses [QMK firmware](https://docs.qmk.fm/) and I used the site [VIA](https://usevia.app/).  
  
  
Wireless version uses [nice!nano](https://nicekeyboards.com/nice-nano/) v.2 micro controllers with [ZMK firmware](https://zmk.dev/) and used the site [keymap editor](https://nickcoutsos.github.io/keymap-editor/) to make changes
